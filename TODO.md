# TODO: Make Code Fully Responsive

## Steps to Complete

- [ ] Update Voc.jsx: Ensure table is fully responsive with proper padding and button stacking on small screens.
- [ ] Update PrivateGpt.jsx: Change non-standard 'xs:' breakpoint to 'sm:' for standard Tailwind.
- [ ] Check and update other components (Vob, Vom, BuyerIntelligence, UserManagement, PromptLibrary, ForgetPassword, NewPassword, Buttons/ThemeToggleButton) for any responsiveness issues.
- [ ] Test the app on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) after updates.
- [ ] Run the app locally to verify responsiveness.
