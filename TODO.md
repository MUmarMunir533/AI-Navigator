# TODO: Update Navbar for Functional Navigation

## Tasks

- [ ] Update App.jsx to add nested routes for all navbar items (Private GPT, VOC, VOB, VOM, Buyer Intelligence, User Management, Prompt Library)
- [ ] Update Dashboard.jsx to use <Outlet /> for rendering nested components instead of hardcoded PrivateGpt
- [ ] Update Navbar.jsx to add navigation logic using useNavigate for both small screen dropdown and large screen list items
- [ ] Test navigation on both large and small screens to ensure pages open correctly
